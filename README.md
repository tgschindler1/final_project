# Final Project Report

* Class: DS 5100
* Student Name: Thomas Schindler
* Project Name: Montecarlo Simulator

The module will implement a simple [Monte Carlo
simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) using a set
of three related classes â€” a Die class, a Game class, and an Analyzer
class.

The classes are related in the following way: Game objects are
initialized with a Die object, and Analyzer objects are initialized with
a Game object.

\[Die\] &rarr; \[Game\] &rarr; \[Analyzer\]
